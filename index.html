	This is my site. Git is pretty cool honestly. I've always wanted to learn it and now I finally am which is pretty dope.
  I should probably dual boot linux on my laptop because windows is ass.

  But yeah I'm a freshman at UB majoring in computer science and I'm having a pretty good time so far.

  My favorite activities include:
  Eating
  Sleeping
  Napping
  Longboarding
  Skiing
